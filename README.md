The repo is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [S2ANet](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet/tree/pytorch1.9) branch pytorch1.9, and [UCAS-AOD-benchmark](https://github.com/ming71/UCAS-AOD-benchmark) thanks to their work.

Two versions are provided here: [Original version](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet/tree/original_version) and [v20210104](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet). We recommend to use [v20210104](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet) (i.e. the master branch).

## Introduction
As there is a need for me to run S2ANet on UCAS_AOD. However, there is no present work to do this. This repo is both a tutorial and an extension to original project [S2ANet](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet/tree/pytorch1.9). Besides, I used [UCAS-AOD-benchmark](https://github.com/ming71/UCAS-AOD-benchmark) to prepare for dataset.

The main problems this repo solved are:
- [x] custom dataset training(UCAS_AOD as an example)
- [x] change the backbone to ResNeXt101x64_4d to gain more performance.(this pretrain model is provided in the link below, after downloading, move it to torch pretrain cache dir)
- [x] a tutorial for begineers in remote-sensing
- [x] provide some pretrained models with baidu Netdisk
- [ ] align the accuracy provided in [UCAS-AOD-benchmark](https://github.com/ming71/UCAS-AOD-benchmark) (The Reason might be training params for I only have RTX3060 12G)

## Results for UCAS_AOD
|  class   | ap  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| car  | 80.75557185 |
| airplane  | 90.64514424 |
pretrained model file can be downloaded [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YPeQjtGmXZQhuHWGC3DaMg). code: 0lsj 
## Tutorial for custom training
files to be added :
- DOTA_devkit/ucas_aod_evaluation.py
- mmdet/datasets/UCAS_AOD.py
- tools/test.py
- configs/ucasaod/*

The first one is used when evaluating.\
The second one is for loading custom dataset(like this directory in UCAS_AOD_Benchmark).\
The third is adding params for evaluating.\
The fourth is config file for training.

## Something Important to be noticed
- 1.the processed dataset anno filed(.txt) have 14 cols, and they are $class,x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,theta,x,y, width,height$. And theta is angle not arc(see here).
